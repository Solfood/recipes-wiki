---

## Method

### 1. Toast and Soak the Chiles
Remove stems and seeds from all dried chiles. Toast briefly in a dry pan until fragrant, taking care not to burn them. Cover with hot water and soak 15–20 minutes until fully pliable.

---

### 2. Char the Aromatics
Char half of the onion (cut into large pieces) and the garlic cloves in a dry pan until well blistered. Set aside.

---

### 3. Blend and Strain the Chile Sauce
Blend the soaked chiles, charred onion and garlic, oregano, cumin, salt, and about 1½ cups of the soaking liquid until completely smooth.  
Strain to remove skins and seeds.

**Target consistency:** heavy cream.

---

### 4. Roast the Poblano
Roast the poblano until blistered. Steam for 10 minutes, then peel, seed, and chop. Set aside.

---

### 5. Brown the Beef
Season the tri-tip with salt and pepper. Brown in batches in neutral oil over medium-high heat until deeply colored. Remove to a plate.

---

### 6. Build the Base
In the same pot, sauté the diced onion with a pinch of salt until soft.  
If using, stir in the tomato paste and cook 1–2 minutes until darkened.  
Add the strained chile sauce and stir to combine.

---

### 7. Braise
Return the beef and any accumulated juices to the pot. Add the roasted poblano and beef broth, using enough liquid to mostly submerge the meat without drowning it.  
Bring to a gentle simmer, cover, and cook 2–2½ hours, stirring occasionally, until the beef is tender but holds its shape.

---

### 8. Add the Chocolate
During the final 20–30 minutes, stir in the chopped Abuelita chocolate. Simmer until fully melted and integrated. The effect should be warming and round, never overtly sweet or chocolate-forward.

---

### 9. Optional Micro-Lift
If the mid-palate feels slightly hollow, add ¼–½ tsp crushed freeze-dried shallot and simmer about 10 minutes. This should disappear quietly into the sauce.

---

### 10. Thicken with Masa
Whisk 2 tbsp masa harina with ¼ cup water to form a slurry. Stir into the pot and simmer 10–15 minutes.  
For slightly more body, add up to 1 additional tablespoon of slurry. Avoid exceeding this—too much masa will mute the chile character.

---

### 11. Final Balance
Taste and adjust deliberately:
- If bitterness remains, add ¼–½ tsp brown sugar.  
- If brightness is lacking, add ¾ tsp apple cider vinegar, simmer briefly, and retaste. Add an additional ¼–½ tsp only if needed.  
- Adjust salt to sharpen the chile and beef.

The final profile should feel **deep, clean, bright, and gently rounded**.

---

### 12. Rest and Serve
Rest off heat for 10–15 minutes to allow the sauce to settle. Serve with warm tortillas, lime wedges, and cilantro. A light crumble of queso fresco is optional.

Avoid heavy sour cream, which dulls the finish.

## Chef’s Notes
- ~4 cups stock yields a saucy, competition-style texture.  
- 2–3 tbsp masa provides silkiness without heaviness.  
- ¼ tablet Abuelita adds depth without sweetness.  
- Vinegar is the final tuning tool—use it precisely.
