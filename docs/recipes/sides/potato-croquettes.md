## Ingredients

### Potato Dough
- **1 lb / 450 g cooked potatoes**  
  (about 2 large russets), very well-drained
- **2 tbsp (28 g) melted butter**
- **1 tsp kosher salt**, to start

### Starches (40–60 g total)
- **20–30 g potato starch**
- **20–30 g tapioca flour**

> Add more starch only if the dough is sticky.

### Seasoning Mix (makes ~2–3 tbsp)
- **1 tbsp BBQ rub** (salt level varies—adjust accordingly)
- **1 tsp smoked paprika**
- **1 tsp chili powder**
- **1 tsp sugar**
- **½ tsp garlic powder**
- **½ tsp onion powder**
- **¼ tsp cayenne** (or less, to taste)
- **1 tsp dried parsley**

## Method

1. **Cook and dry the potatoes**  
   Boil until fully tender. Drain thoroughly, then return to the hot pot for **1–2 minutes** to steam off excess moisture.  
   *Drier potatoes = stronger fries.*

2. **Mash ultra-smooth**  
   Mash until completely lump-free. A ricer is ideal.

3. **Make the dough**  
   While the potatoes are still warm, mix in salt and melted butter.  
   Add starches gradually until the dough is **pliable like playdough**—holds together and does not stick to your hands.

4. **Shape**  
   Press dough onto parchment into a slab **⅜–½ inch (8–12 mm) thick**.  
   Cut into squares or sticks.

5. **Freeze (critical step)**  
   Freeze **30–60 minutes** until firm. This prevents breakage during frying.

6. **Fry**  
   Heat neutral oil to **375°F / 190°C**.  
   Fry in small batches until **deep golden and crisp**.

7. **Season immediately**  
   Toss hot fries with seasoning mix. Serve right away.

## Troubleshooting

- **Falls apart in oil**  
  Dough too wet or under-frozen  
  → dry potatoes more, add a bit more starch, freeze longer

- **Gummy interior**  
  Too much tapioca or oil too cool  
  → reduce tapioca share, keep oil hot

- **Not crisping**  
  Oil too cool or pieces too thick  
  → fry hotter or cut thinner

## Notes
- Russet potatoes give the best structure.  
- Yukon Golds work but may need slightly more starch.  
- Squares stay creamier; sticks get crispier edges.
