## Method

### Crust
1.  **Roast the squash**
    Roast butternut squash at **425°F / 220°C** until fully tender and lightly browned.

2.  **Measure and dry**
    Weigh **460 g** of squash after roasting. Mash until smooth.
    If the mash looks glossy or wet, press gently in a clean towel to remove excess moisture.

3.  **Make the dough**
    Mix squash, egg whites, olive oil, and salt until combined.
    Add tapioca and potato starches and mix into a **very thick paste**.

4.  **Roll thin**
    Roll dough between lightly oiled parchment to **~2 mm thickness**. Remove top parchment.

5.  **Par-bake**
    On a fully preheated baking steel (top rack, **525–550°F**), bake with parchment for **7–9 minutes**, until set.

6.  **Flip and finish**
    Remove parchment, flip crust directly onto the steel, and bake **2–3 minutes more**.
    Set aside.

### Toppings
1.  **Cook the bacon**
    Cook bacon until just crisp. Chop and reserve the fat.

2.  **Sauté the mushrooms**
    Cook mushrooms in bacon fat over medium-high heat until **all moisture is gone** and mushrooms are lightly browned.
    Salt lightly at the end.

3.  **Make the white sauce**
    Mix cream cheese, bacon fat, garlic, lemon juice, black pepper, and salt (if needed) until smooth and spreadable.

## Assemble & Bake
1.  Brush the crust lightly with olive oil.
2.  Spread a **thin, even layer** of white sauce.
3.  Add a light layer of mozzarella.
4.  Top with mushrooms and bacon.
5.  Finish with remaining mozzarella (and optional Parmesan or provolone).
6.  Bake at **475–500°F** for **3–5 minutes**, just until the cheese melts.
7.  Rest **1–2 minutes** before slicing.

!!! tip "Notes"
    *   Keep toppings **light and dry** to prevent scorching on the steel.
    *   Low-moisture mozzarella is essential for clean melting.
    *   Bacon provides most of the salt; adjust only after baking.
    *   Optional finish: cracked black pepper or chopped chives.
