??? question "Homemade Sodium Citrate (From Citric Acid + Baking Soda)"

    If you don’t have sodium citrate powder, you can make a liquid solution:

    **Ingredients**
    *   Food-grade citric acid
    *   Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate)
    *   Water

    **Ratio**
    For every **10 g** citric acid, use **13.1 g** baking soda.

    **Method**
    1.  Warm **½ cup water** in a saucepan (hot but not boiling).
    2.  Dissolve the citric acid completely.
    3.  Add baking soda **very slowly**, stirring constantly (it will foam and fizz).
    4.  When additions cause **little to no fizz**, stop and simmer gently **2–3 minutes**.
    5.  Cool and store in a jar in the fridge.
    
    **Use:** If you want a consistent strength, reduce the liquid to about **½ cup** total volume to concentrate it.
