# Silky Cheese Sauce (8 oz) — With Optional Green Chiles  
*(Milk • Butter • Sodium Citrate — Smooth, Stable, Reheats Clean)*

**Yield:** ~1¾ cups (plenty for 4 people’s nachos)  
**Texture target:** glossy, pourable sauce that stays smooth as it cools

---

## Ingredients

### Base
- ¾ cup whole milk  
- 1½ tbsp unsalted butter  
- 1¾ tsp **sodium citrate** (store-bought)  
- 8 oz cheese, freshly grated *(cheddar, Colby, or a blend)*

### Seasoning
- ½ tsp garlic powder  
- ½ tsp onion powder  

### Optional (Highly Recommended)
- 1 (4 oz) can diced **green chiles**, drained  

### Optional to Finish
- Salt, only if needed  
- Splash of milk to loosen (as needed)

---

## Method

### 1) Build the Emulsifying Base
In a small saucepan over **medium** heat, combine the milk, butter, and sodium citrate.  
Whisk until the butter is melted and the liquid is fully smooth and steaming. Do not boil.

### 2) Melt in the Cheese
Reduce heat to **medium-low**. Add the cheese in small handfuls, whisking constantly.  
Let each addition melt completely before adding more.

You’re looking for a smooth, glossy sauce with no graininess.

### 3) Season + Add Chiles
Whisk in garlic powder and onion powder.  
Stir in drained green chiles if using.

### 4) Final Texture Check
- Too thick → whisk in warm milk, 1–2 tbsp at a time  
- Too thin → add a small handful of cheese or simmer 30–60 seconds (gentle heat)

Taste and add salt only if the cheese you used is under-seasoned.

---

## Notes
- **Gentle heat is the key.** Once the cheese is in, avoid boiling.
- This sauce thickens as it cools; a splash of milk brings it right back.

---

## Storage & Reheating
- Refrigerate up to **5 days**
- Reheat on low heat (stovetop) or in short microwave bursts, whisking often
- Add a splash of milk as needed to restore flow

# Homemade Sodium Citrate (From Citric Acid + Baking Soda)  
*(Optional — if you don’t have the real powder)*

## What You Need
- Food-grade **citric acid**  
- **Baking soda** (sodium bicarbonate)  
- Water, small saucepan, spoon, and ideally a kitchen scale

## Ratio (Most Reliable)
For every **10 g citric acid**, use **13.1 g baking soda**.

## Method (Liquid Stock — Easiest and Most Reliable)
1. Warm **½ cup water** in a saucepan (hot but not boiling).
2. Dissolve the citric acid completely.
3. Add baking soda **very slowly**, stirring constantly (it will foam and fizz).
4. When additions cause **little to no fizz**, stop and simmer gently **2–3 minutes**.
5. Cool and store in a jar in the fridge.

**Use:** If you want a consistent strength, reduce the liquid to about **½ cup** total volume to concentrate it.  
A concentrated stock is easier to dose in recipes.

## Notes
- Drying homemade citrate often concentrates off-flavors. Liquid stock is far more forgiving.
- The finished solution should taste neutral to mildly mineral/salty—**not chalky** and not sour.
