    *   **Texture target:** TBD
    *   **Cook time:** ** 0 mins (Fermentation: 10-14 days)

## Ingredients
**For 1 lb cucumbers (split between 2 jars):**
- [ ] 1 lb mini seedless cucumbers, washed, blossom ends trimmed
- [ ] 4 cloves garlic, smashed (2 per jar)
- [ ] 2 tsp black peppercorns (1 tsp per jar)
- [ ] 2 tsp coriander seeds (1 tsp per jar)
- [ ] 1/2 tsp mustard seeds (optional, divide between jars)
- [ ] 2 bay leaves (1 per jar)
- [ ] 2 dried red chilis (optional, for spice—1 per jar)
- [ ] 4 sprigs fresh dill (2 per jar) or 1 tsp dill seed per jar
- [ ] 2 grape leaves or black tea bags (1 per jar — optional but helps with crispness)

**Basic 2.5% brine:**
- [ ] 2 cups non-chlorinated water
- [ ] 1.5 tbsp kosher or sea salt (without iodine or anti-caking agents)

## Method
### Step 1: Sterilize Jars and Equipment
1. Wash jars, lids, airlocks, and any weights in **hot soapy water**.
2. Rinse well.
3. To sanitize:
   - Option 1: Pour boiling water over jars and parts, let sit 2–3 minutes.
   - Option 2: Soak in a mix of 1 tbsp bleach per gallon of water for 5 minutes, then rinse thoroughly with clean water.
4. Let everything **air dry** on a clean towel.

### Step 2: Make the Brine
1. Dissolve salt in water completely.
2. Taste it — should be pleasantly salty.
3. Double this if needed; you may need ~2.5–3 cups total to fill both jars.

### Step 3: Pack the Jars
1. Add spices, garlic, dill, and grape leaf/tea bag to bottom of each jar.
2. Pack cucumbers in **tightly but gently** — avoid breaking them.
3. Pour brine over until **everything is fully submerged**. Leave 1 inch headspace.
4. Add **fermentation weights** or a small brine-filled zip-top bag to keep cucumbers submerged.

### Step 4: Attach the Airlock Lids
1. Make sure airlocks are filled with water to the fill line.
2. Insert into lid grommets.
3. Screw lids on finger-tight — don’t over-tighten.

### Step 5: Fermentation
1. Place jars on a plate or tray (brine may bubble over).
2. Keep at **room temperature (65–75°F)** out of direct sunlight.
3. Check daily:
   - Bubbles? Good!
   - Brine cloudy? Normal!
   - Floating bits? Push down or remove.
4. **Taste at Day 5–7. Full sour often takes 10–14 days.**

### Step 6: Finish and Store
1. Once they taste sour, garlicky, and “deli-style”:
2. Remove weights.
3. Swap lids for regular mason jar lids (or keep airlock on).
4. Refrigerate.
They’ll keep **months** in the fridge and flavor will deepen.

### Notes:
- If you see **white film (kahm yeast)**, it’s harmless — skim it off.
- Avoid mold (blue/green/black fuzz) by keeping everything submerged.
- Save leftover brine for next batch or use in salad dressings.

### Calculating Brine Percentage
To make brine for any amount of water, use a scale:
`Water Weight (g) x Percentage = Salt Weight (g)`

**Example for 2.5% brine:**
- 1,000g water x 0.025 = 25g salt
- 500g water x 0.025 = 12.5g salt
