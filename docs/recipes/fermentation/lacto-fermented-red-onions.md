# Lacto-Fermented Red Onions
*Delicious Lacto-Fermented Red Onions recipe*

!!! info "Recipe Details"
    *   **Yield:** ** 1 Quart Jar
    *   **Prep time:** ** ~15 mins
    *   **Texture target:** TBD
    *   **Cook time:** ** 0 mins (Fermentation: 5-7 days)

## Ingredients
**For 1 quart jar:**
- [ ] 1–2 red onions, peeled and sliced into rings or half-moons
- [ ] 1 garlic clove (optional, adds depth)
- [ ] 1/2 tsp black peppercorns (optional)
- [ ] 1 bay leaf (optional)
- [ ] 1 tsp coriander seeds or mustard seeds (optional)
- [ ] 1 black tea bag (for crunch if you like — optional for onions)

**Brine:**
- [ ] 2 cups water (dechlorinated)
- [ ] 1 tbsp kosher salt (slightly less salty than the cucumbers — ~2% solution is better for onions)
> You can also reuse the leftover brine if it’s fresh and not slimy — just top off with more water and salt if needed.

## Method
1. **Slice onions** and pack into the jar with any desired spices.
2. **Add brine** until onions are submerged.
3. **Weigh them down** — they float more than cucumbers! A fermentation weight or brine-filled zip-top bag works.
4. **Seal with your airlock lid.**
5. **Ferment at room temperature for 5–7 days.** Taste daily after day 3.
6. Once tangy and translucent, move to the **fridge**. They’ll last months and keep getting better.

### Flavor Tips:
- Add a few slices of jalapeño or chili for spicy pickled onions.
- Add a pinch of sugar for a mild sweet-and-sour deli vibe.
- You can skip tannins (tea/grape leaf) for onions — they don’t need crunch like cukes do.

### Calculating Brine Percentage
To make brine for any amount of water, use a scale:
`Water Weight (g) x Percentage = Salt Weight (g)`

**Example for 2% brine (recommended for onions):**
- 1,000g water x 0.020 = 20g salt
- 500g water x 0.020 = 10g salt
