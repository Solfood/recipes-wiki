!!! info "Recipe Details"
    *   **Yield:** ** 4-6 servings
    *   **Prep time:** ** 30 mins (marinate) + prep
    *   **Texture target:** TBD
    *   **Cook time:** ** 12-15 mins

## Ingredients
- [ ] 1.5 lb salmon filets (with skin or without)
- [ ] Zest and juice of 1 orange
- [ ] 1 Tbsp grated fresh ginger
- [ ] 1 Tbsp honey
- [ ] 1 tsp salt
- [ ] ½ tsp ground black pepper
- [ ] 1 tbsp olive oil
- [ ] Optional: 1 tsp ground coriander for warmth and depth

## Method
1. Place salmon filets in an oven-safe dish.
2. Whisk together the citrus zest/juice, ginger, honey, salt, pepper, olive oil, and coriander.
3. Pour the glaze over the salmon filets, coating them evenly.
4. **Marinate & Form Pellicle:**
   - Let sit 30 minutes for flavor infusion.
   - Remove salmon filets from the glaze (reserve the glaze for basting) and place them on a wire rack over a baking sheet.
   - Refrigerate uncovered overnight to allow a pellicle (a sticky, tacky surface) to form. This helps smoke adhere and improves texture.
5. Bake at 375°F (or smoke if desired) for 12–15 minutes, basting occasionally with the reserved glaze, until flaky and cooked to your preference.
