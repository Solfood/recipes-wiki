## Ingredients

### For poaching the shrimp
- [ ] 1.5 pounds shrimp (31-40 count) – peeled, deveined, and tails removed
- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon Diamond Crystal Kosher salt
- [ ] 8 cups water
- [ ] 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
- [ ] 2 teaspoons Old Bay seasoning

### For the sauce
- [ ] 1/2 cup finely diced celery
- [ ] 1/4 cup finely diced red onion
- [ ] 1 tablespoon minced dill, plus more to taste
- [ ] 3/4 cup mayonnaise
- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon Old Bay seasoning
- [ ] 1 teaspoon celery seed
- [ ] 2 ounces lemon juice
- [ ] 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
- [ ] Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

### Poaching the shrimp
1. Mix the shrimp well with the baking soda, salt, and Old Bay seasoning and set aside. Wait 15-20 minutes until boiling. While the shrimp are sitting in the brine, mix the sauce.
2. Prepare a large bowl of ice water for shocking the shrimp and set aside.
3. Add the water and lemon juice to a large pot and bring to a boil.
4. Add the shrimp to the pot and cook for 90 seconds or until they turn slightly opaque. Place the shrimp immediately into the ice water bath to stop the cooking process. Drain the shrimp in a colander and pat dry with paper towels.

### For the sauce
1. In a large bowl, mix together all of the ingredients. Taste test and adjust salt and pepper if required.
2. Add the shrimp to the sauce and coat well. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours but preferably overnight to let the flavors meld.
3. The next day, for a dryer salad, strain the shrimp through a colander to drain the liquid. Serve immediately. Enjoy!

## Notes
- It is recommended to refrigerate overnight. The flavor will be much better and the shrimp salad can be drained to remove excess water.
- For convenience, cleaned and deveined 31-40 count shrimp were used. Feel free to use shell on shrimp if you desire and peel right after shocking in the ice water bath.
- Any size shrimp can be used. Larger shrimp will take more time so keep an eye on them. Once they are opaque, they are done and should be shocked in ice water immediately.
- Leftovers can be kept in the fridge for up to 3 days.
